# Diffusion Models Project: A Deep Dive

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation and exploration of various Denoising Diffusion Models. It is designed to be a clear, modular, and extensible framework for understanding, training, and experimenting with diffusion-based generative models.

This document serves as an in-depth guide for other AI assistants (like GPT) to understand the project's architecture, technical implementation, and core concepts, enabling the generation of a detailed project report.

## 1. Core Concepts: The Theory Behind Diffusion Models

Diffusion models are probabilistic generative models that learn to generate data by simulating a reversing a diffusion process. This project implements two main variants: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM).

### 1.1. The Forward Process (Noising) - `q(x_t | x_{t-1})`

The forward process gradually adds Gaussian noise to an input image `x_0` over a series of `T` timesteps. This is a fixed Markov chain, meaning it doesn't involve any learnable parameters.

- **Formula:** `q(x_t | x_0) = sqrt(alpha_bar_t) * x_0 + sqrt(1 - alpha_bar_t) * epsilon`
- **Implementation:** This is implemented in `DDPM_Model.q_sample`.
  - `betas`: A predefined variance schedule `beta_t` that increases from `beta_start` to `beta_end` over `T` steps.
  - `alphas`: `alpha_t = 1 - beta_t`.
  - `alpha_bars`: `torch.cumprod(alphas, dim=0)`, representing the cumulative product of alphas. This allows sampling `x_t` directly from `x_0` at any timestep `t`.
  - `noise`: `epsilon`, a random tensor from a standard normal distribution.

### 1.2. The Reverse Process (Denoising) - `p_theta(x_{t-1} | x_t)`

The reverse process is the core of the generative model. It learns to reverse the noising process, starting from pure noise `x_T` and gradually denoising it to produce a clean image `x_0`.

- **Goal:** To approximate the true posterior `q(x_{t-1} | x_t, x_0)` with a learned neural network `p_theta(x_{t-1} | x_t)`.
- **The U-Net Model:** The project uses a U-Net model (`models/unet.py`) to predict the noise `epsilon` that was added to the image at timestep `t`.
- **Loss Function:** The model is trained with a simple Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the predicted noise and the actual noise that was added. This is implemented in `DDPM_Model.calculate_loss`.

### 1.3. Sampling: From Noise to Image

#### DDPM Sampling

- **Stochastic Process:** DDPM sampling is a stochastic process that involves adding a small amount of noise back at each step of the reverse process.
- **Implementation:** `DDPM_Model.p_sample_loop`.
- **Formula:** `x_{t-1} = (1/sqrt(alpha_t)) * (x_t - (beta_t / sqrt(1 - alpha_bar_t)) * predicted_noise) + sqrt(beta_t) * z` where `z` is new random noise. This makes the generation path stochastic.
- **Trade-off:** Produces high-quality samples but is very slow, requiring all `T` steps (e.g., 1000).

#### DDIM Sampling

- **Deterministic Process:** DDIM provides a faster, deterministic sampling process. By setting the `eta` parameter to 0, the stochastic noise term is removed.
- **Implementation:** `DDIM_Model.ddim_step` and `DDIM_Model.p_sample_loop`.
- **Benefit:** Allows for a much smaller number of sampling steps (e.g., 50) without a significant drop in quality, making it much faster than DDPM. It achieves this by "skipping" steps in the reverse chain.

## 3. Detailed Model Implementation (`models/` directory)

### 3.1. `models/unet.py` - The Noise Predictor

- **`UNet` Class:** A standard U-Net architecture.
  - **Encoder:** A series of convolutional blocks (`enc1`, `enc2`, `enc3`) with `MaxPool2d` for downsampling. It progressively extracts features and reduces spatial dimensions.
  - **Bottleneck & Time Embedding:**
    - At the bottleneck, a time embedding is injected. The timestep `t` is converted into a vector using a `time_mlp` (a simple multi-layer perceptron).
    - This time vector is then broadcast and multiplied with the feature maps, allowing the model to learn conditional noise prediction based on the current diffusion step.
  - **Decoder:** A series of convolutional blocks (`dec3_conv`, `dec2_conv`, `dec1`) that use `F.interpolate` (bilinear upsampling) to increase spatial dimensions.
  - **Skip Connections:** Feature maps from the encoder are concatenated (`torch.cat`) with the corresponding upsampled feature maps in the decoder. This is crucial for preserving high-frequency details and stabilizing training.
  - **Output:** The final layer is a `Conv2d` that outputs a tensor of the same shape as the input image (3 channels), representing the predicted noise `epsilon`.

### 3.2. `models/ddpm.py` - Core DDPM Logic

- **`DDPM_Model(nn.Module)` Class:**
  - **`__init__`**:
    - Initializes the `UNet` model.
    - Pre-calculates the diffusion schedule parameters (`betas`, `alphas`, `alpha_bars`) and stores them as buffers. This is a one-time calculation that is fixed throughout training and inference.
  - **`q_sample(x_0, t, noise)`**: Implements the forward process formula to generate a noisy image `x_t` from a clean image `x_0` at any timestep `t`.
  - **`calculate_loss(x_0, t)`**: The core training step.
    1.  Generates random noise `epsilon`.
    2.  Creates a noisy image `x_t` using `q_sample`.
    3.  Feeds `x_t` and `t` into the `self.unet` to get `predicted_noise`.
    4.  Computes `F.mse_loss(predicted_noise, noise)`.
  - **`train_model(...)`**: The main training loop. It iterates through the dataloader, samples random timesteps `t` for each image, calculates the loss, and performs backpropagation.
  - **`p_sample_loop(shape)`**: The generative sampling loop (inference).
    1.  Starts with pure random noise `x = torch.randn(shape)`.
    2.  Iterates backwards from `t = T-1` down to `0`.
    3.  In each step, it calls the `self.unet` to predict the noise in the current `x`.
    4.  It then applies the DDPM sampling formula to calculate the slightly less noisy `x_{t-1}`. This includes the stochastic noise term `torch.sqrt(beta_t) * noise`.
    5.  The final `x` is the generated image.
  - **`sample(num_samples, dataset_name)`**: A wrapper around `p_sample_loop` that determines the correct image shape based on the dataset name.

### 3.3. `models/ddim.py` - Fast, Deterministic Sampling

- **`DDIM_Model(DDPM_Model)` Class:** Inherits from `DDPM_Model` but overrides the sampling logic.
  - **`p_sample_loop(shape, ddim_steps, eta)`**: The DDIM sampling loop.
    - It creates a custom sequence of timesteps to "skip" steps (e.g., using `ddim_steps=50` out of `T=1000`).
    - It calls `ddim_step` in its loop.
  - **`ddim_step(x_t, t, t_prev, eta)`**: Implements the core DDIM update rule.
    - It's a deterministic transformation from `x_t` to `x_{t-1}` if `eta=0`.
    - `eta > 0` reintroduces some stochasticity, interpolating between a pure DDIM (`eta=0`) and a DDPM-like (`eta=1`) process.
    - It first predicts `x_0` from `x_t` and the predicted noise, and then uses this to derive the direction to `x_{t-1}`.

### 3.4. `models/conditional_ddpm.py` & `conditional_unet.py`

- **Concept:** Guides the image generation process based on a class label (e.g., "generate a cat").
- **`ConditionalUNet`:**
  - The `forward` method now accepts an additional argument `labels`.
  - An `nn.Embedding` layer converts the integer class labels into dense vectors.
  - These label embeddings are processed through an MLP and then added to the time embeddings. The combined embedding conditions the U-Net's behavior.
- **`ConditionalDDPM_Model`:**
  - It uses the `ConditionalUNet` instead of the standard `UNet`.
  - The `calculate_loss` and `p_sample_loop` methods are modified to accept and pass the `labels` tensor to the U-Net.
  - The `sample` method now requires a `labels` tensor as input to specify which classes to generate.

### 3.5. `inpaint_ddpm.py` - Image Inpainting

- **`InpaintDDPM(DDPM_Model)` Class:**
  - **Concept:** Given an image with a missing region (masked), the model fills in the missing part.
  - **`inpaint(x_0_known, mask)`**: The main inpainting loop.
  - **`inpaint_sample_step(x_t, t, x_0_known, mask)`**: The key modification to the sampling process.
    1.  Performs a standard DDPM reverse step to get a candidate `x_{t-1}`.
    2.  The "known" region of the original image (`x_0_known`) is noised to the appropriate level for timestep `t-1`, resulting in `x_0_known_noisy`.
    3.  The final `x_{t-1}` is a composite: `mask * x_0_known_noisy + (1 - mask) * x_t_prev`. This means the known region is constantly replaced with the correctly noised ground truth, forcing the model to generate the unknown region conditioned on the known parts.

## 4. Analysis of Executable Scripts

### 4.1. `train_and_evaluate.py` (Main Script)

- **Purpose:** A centralized, configurable script for running complete experiments.
- **Workflow:**
  1.  Parses command-line arguments (`--task`, `--config`).
  2.  Loads a configuration (either default from `config.py` or a custom YAML file).
  3.  Initializes the specified model (DDPM or DDIM).
  4.  Prepares the correct dataset (CIFAR-10 or CelebA) with appropriate transforms.
  5.  Calls the model's `train_model` method.
  6.  After training, it calls an `evaluate` function (which calculates FID score) and a `sample` function to generate and save final image grids.
  7.  Saves logs, checkpoints, and output images to a structured directory like `outputs/cifar10_ddpm_timestamp/`.

### 4.2. `test_ddpm_cifar.py` (Inference/Testing Script)

- **Purpose:** To load a pre-trained DDPM model and generate sample images. This script was the subject of the debugging session.
- **Workflow:**
  1.  Specifies the model path (`diffusion_model_cifar.pth`).
  2.  Loads the model's `state_dict`.
  3.  Calls `model.sample()` to generate images.
  4.  **Crucially**, it performs post-processing on the output samples before saving.
- **Post-Processing Logic (The Fix):**
  - The raw output of a diffusion model is typically in the `[-1, 1]` range (or can be outside this if not fully trained).
  - The original code used a simple `(samples + 1) / 2` to shift this to `[0, 1]` for saving.
  - **Problem:** If the model is poorly trained and outputs values clustered around `-1`, this results in values close to `0` (black image).
  - **Solution:** The script now includes "intelligent normalization." It checks the output range. If the range is not close to `[-1, 1]`, it applies a more robust min-max normalization (`(samples - min) / (max - min)`) to stretch whatever range is present to the full `[0, 1]` visible spectrum. This ensures that even a poorly trained model produces a visible (though not necessarily coherent) image, which is vital for debugging.

### 4.3. `compare_ddim_ddpm.py` (Comparison Script)

- **Purpose:** To provide a side-by-side visual and performance comparison of DDPM and DDIM sampling.
- **Workflow:**
  1.  Loads a pre-trained DDPM model (DDIM uses the same U-Net weights).
  2.  Generates a set of images using slow DDPM sampling (e.g., 1000 steps).
  3.  Generates images from the same initial noise using fast DDIM sampling (e.g., 50 steps).
  4.  Records the time taken for each.
  5.  Saves a composite image (`ddim_vs_ddpm_comparison.png`) showing the results and timings, clearly demonstrating the speed/quality trade-off.

## 5. How to Use This Project (Workflow)

1.  **Installation:**
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib scipy pillow
    ```
2.  **Training a Model:**
    The recommended way is to use the main script. This will train a DDPM on CIFAR-10, save the model, and generate samples.
    ```bash
    python train_and_evaluate.py --task cifar10
    ```
3.  **Generating Samples from a Trained Model:**
    Use the test script to load the checkpoint and generate images.
    ```bash
    python test_ddpm_cifar.py
    ```
    The output `ddpm_cifar_test_samples.png` will be created.

4.  **Comparing Samplers:**
    To see the difference between DDIM and DDPM:
    ```bash
    python compare_ddim_ddpm.py
    ```
5.  **Conditional Generation:**
    First, train a conditional model:
    ```bash
    python conditional_diffusion.py --train --epochs 50
    ```
    Then, sample images of a specific class (e.g., class 1 for "car"):
    ```bash
    python conditional_diffusion.py --sample --class_id 1
    ```
